Given a linked list A and a value B, partition it such that all nodes less than B come before nodes greater than or equal to B. 
You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions. 
Input 1: 
A = [1, 4, 3, 2, 5, 2]
B = 3
Input 2: 
A = [1, 2, 3, 1, 3]
B = 2
Output 1: 
[1, 2, 2, 4, 3, 5]
Output 2: 
[1, 1, 2, 3, 3]
Explanation 1:
[1, 2, 2] are less than B wheread [4, 3, 5] are greater than or equal to B.
Explanation 2:
[1, 1] are less than B wheread [2, 3, 3] are greater than or equal to B.
